Accelerometer Project for EECE2160\n
Designed in collaboration with Stephen Sodipo, Northeastern University\n
The objective of the project was to connect the accelerometer on the DE1SoC board to the HPS, process the data into mg units, and connect that data further to digital logic functions programmed to the FPGA. The logic systems were used to translate angular acceleration in mg units to an angle and display this angle on the Linux console and DE1SoC seven segment displays. To complete this lab, one must have knowledge of the HPS system, virtual memory mapping, the ADXL345 communication protocol, digital logic design, and how to link the HPS and FPGA on the DE1SoC.
